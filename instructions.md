# Coup Rules

- Number of players: 3-6
- **Object**: To be the only player with any influence cards left.
- **Materials**: Deck of influence cards, bank of coins.
- **Set-up**: Shuffle the cards and deal two to each player. Players should look at their cards but keep them
  hidden from everyone else. Each player takes two coind from the bank as their starting wealth.
  Cards: There are five different characters in the influence deck (three copies of each character). Each
  of the five characters has one or more special abilities. The Duke (takes taxes and Blocks Foreign Aid),
  the Assassin (forces one player to give up an Influence card), the Captain (steals two coins from
  another player, Blocks stealing attempts), Ambassador (lets you swap or appear to swap your Influence
  cards with new ones from the deck, Blocks stealing attempts), the Countessa (Blocks assassination
  attempts).
- **Play**: Starting with the player to the left of the dealer and going clockwise, players take turns
  performing one of the available actions. 1. Income: Take one coin from the bank. This cannot be Challenged or Blocked. 2. Foreign Aid: Take two coins from the bank. This cannot be Challenged but it can be Blocked by
  the Duke. 3. Coup: Costs seven coins. Cause a player to give up an Influence card. Cannot be Challenged or
  Blocked. If you start your turn with 10+ coins, you must take this action. 4. Taxes (the Duke): Take three coins from the bank. Can be Challenged. 5. Assassinate (the Assassin): Costs three coins. Force one player to give up an Influence card of
  their choice. Can be Challenged. Can be Blocked by the Contessa. 6. Steal (the Captain): Take two coins from another player. Can be Challenged. Can be Blocked by
  another Captain or an Ambassador. 7. Swap Influence (the Ambassador): Draw two Influence cards from the deck, look at them and
  mix them with your current Influence card(s). Place two cards back in the deck and shuffle the
  deck. Can be Challenged. Cannot be Blocked.

- **Blocking**: If another player takes an action that can be Blocked, any other player may Block it by
  claiming to have the proper character on one of their Influence cards. The acting player cannpt perform
  the action and takes no other action this turn. The acting player MAY choose to Challenge the Blocking
  player. If they win the Challenge, the action goes through as normal.

- **Challenge**: When the acting player declares their action, any other player may Challenge their right to
  take the action. They are saying “I don't believe you have the proper character to do that.” The acting
  player now must prove they have the power to take the action or lose the Challenge. If they have the
  right character, they reveal it and place the revealed card back in the deck. They then shuffle the deck
  and draw a new card. The Challenging player has lost the Callenge. If the do NOT have the proper
  character, they lose the Challenge.

- **Losing a Challenge**: Any player who loses a Challenge must turn one of their Influence cards face up
  for all to see. If that is their last Influence card, they are out of the game.

- **Losing Influence**: Any time a player loses an Influence card, THEY choose which of their cards to
  reveal.
